# learn_javascript
My JavaScript adventures

## Requirements
1. Node JS
2. Node Package Manager (NPM)

## Installation Instructions
1. git clone this repository
2. change directory into *learn_javascript*
3. execute `npm install`

The node modules from *package.json* will be downloaded.

## Directory structure
All adventures are store inside adventure/ directory. Inside that directory are a series of numerically labeled adventure. The description of each adventure is documented below.

## Adventures
**01** - Using Jest for Unit testing - See `__test__` folder. [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/) is a javascript unit testing framework used by FaceBook. It uses a series of *expected()* style functions to perform assertions; see [API for expected()](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/expect.html) usage.

To run a test, execute `npm test`. All tests needs to be included inside `__test__` folder. *sum.test.js* will run tests against /adventure/01/sum.js

To view this adventure, use `npm test` command in terminal

**02** - Modifying the DOM with JavaScript. In this adventure, I have created a `<ul>` and `<li>` element. I then added my own text into `<li>` and appended `<li>` into `<ul>`. The purpose of this adventure is to learn creating HTML elements using pure JavaScript and adding content into the webpage.

**03** - Recoding ECMAScript6's **new** keyword. In this adventure, I have coded the implementations under the hood of the **new** keyword in JavaScript.

To view this adventure, use NodeJS to execute this code in terminal: `node 03.js`

---

**04** - Arrow functions. In this adventure, I will explore how arrow functions in ES6 works.

**05** - **bind** keyword. In this adventure, I will explore what is the purpose of bind and how to use it.

To view this adventure, use NodeJS to execute this code in terminal: `node 05.js`

**06** - Currying. Currying in JS allows a function to accumulatively collect its arguments and process output when all arguments have been collected. It guarantees the order in which arguments are collected by returning a series of functions that are nested. ECMAScript does not currently have a curry method to curry functions natively, but libraries such as lodash can be imported to perform this function. Reference to the adventure can be found [here](https://youtu.be/iZLP4qOwY8I)

To view this adventure, use NodeJS to execute this code in terminal: `node 06.js`
