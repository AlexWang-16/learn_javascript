These adventures are based on the things I encounter and learn as I am to become more proficient at JavaScript. I am no authority of JavaScript and therefore are prone to errors.
If there's a concept you know I've made mistakes on, spelling errors or grammar mistakes, feel free to provide a pull request or file an issue.

I would also love to see JavaScript adventures you've been on as well. If you would like to add to the list of concepts, feel free to send a pull request for that as well.

Furthermore, all adventures must include live example of the end result of applying the method/concept/pattern that a learner can see by executing `node` command in terminal.
